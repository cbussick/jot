# Shelf

A small, private, self-hosted notes app for text and images. It is designed for one owner and works across desktop, tablet, and phone.

## Stack

- React, TypeScript, Vite, StyleX, and TanStack Query
- Express and TypeScript
- SQLite for notes, sessions, and image metadata
- Filesystem storage for image bytes
- Zod parsing at environment, HTTP, browser-storage, and API boundaries
- IndexedDB and a service worker for local-first editing and offline startup
- Docker Compose for deployment

## What it supports

- Create, edit, search, pin, color, and permanently delete notes
- Up to six JPG, PNG, WebP, or GIF images per note
- Local-first saving with an honest sync status
- Offline startup after the first successful visit
- Offline note creation and editing; queued changes sync while Shelf is open and connected
- Conflict protection that preserves the local edit as a conflict copy
- Installable PWA on supported browsers and operating systems
- Android share-sheet target for screenshots and other JPG, PNG, WebP, or GIF images
- One owner password with revocable, server-side sessions

The app deliberately has no labels, checklists, archive, reminders, trash, sharing, or multi-user administration.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 24+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4273`. The first visit asks you to create the owner password. Development data is written to `./data`.

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run audit
```

## Deploy with Docker Compose and Tailscale Serve

Build and start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Compose publishes Shelf only on the VPS loopback interface at `127.0.0.1:3000`. It is not exposed on the VPS's public interfaces.

Expose it privately to your Tailnet with HTTPS:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg localhost:3000
```

Use the `https://…ts.net` URL reported by Tailscale. HTTPS is required for installation and service-worker functionality. Do not use Tailscale Funnel unless you intentionally want public internet access.

The first visit creates the only owner account. There are no default credentials.

## Persistent data and backups

The `shelf-data` Docker volume contains:

```text
/data/shelf.sqlite
/data/shelf.sqlite-wal
/data/shelf.sqlite-shm
/data/images/
```

Back up the database and image directory together. The safest simple procedure is:

```bash
mkdir -p backups
docker compose stop shelf
docker run --rm -v shelf-data:/data:ro -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" \
  alpine tar czf "/backup/shelf-$(date +%F-%H%M%S).tar.gz" -C /data .
docker compose start shelf
```

Test restoring backups periodically. Browser storage is a convenience for offline work, not a backup.

### One-time migration from jot

Do this once before starting this release against an existing deployment. The live installation used Compose project `sticky-notes-app`, service `jot`, and volume `jot-data`. **Do not start the new service with an empty volume**: it would prompt to set up a new owner. Unsynced edits and incoming share drafts in browsers are not migrated; open the old app on each device and wait for **Synced** first if they matter. Devices must sign in again after the cookie rename.

```bash
# On the server, confirm the source exists before Docker can create an empty one.
docker volume inspect jot-data
# Stop the old container to checkpoint SQLite and free port 3000.
docker stop sticky-notes-app-jot-1
mkdir -p "$HOME/backups/shelf"
docker run --rm -v jot-data:/data:ro -v "$HOME/backups/shelf:/backup" \
  alpine tar czf "/backup/pre-migration-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).tar.gz" -C /data .

# Copy the old volume, preserving file ownership. Rename the database and any
# SQLite sidecars together. The old volume and stopped container are rollback points.
docker volume create shelf-data
docker run --rm -v jot-data:/old:ro -v shelf-data:/new alpine sh -ec '
  test -s /old/jot.sqlite
  cp -a /old/. /new/
  for path in /new/jot.sqlite*; do
    [ -e "$path" ] || continue
    mv "$path" "/new/shelf.sqlite${path#/new/jot.sqlite}"
  done
  test -s /new/shelf.sqlite
'

docker compose up -d --build
# Confirm `docker compose ps` is healthy and that your notes and images load.
# Once verified, remove the stopped old container; retain jot-data for rollback.
docker rm sticky-notes-app-jot-1
```

The new Compose project, service, and volume are all named `shelf`. The PWA keeps the same URL and scope; installed copies still receive update prompts. If the cutover fails, stop `shelf` (`docker compose stop shelf`) and restart the old container (`docker start sticky-notes-app-jot-1`) before removing it.

## Updates

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

The PWA downloads frontend updates in the background and offers a **Refresh app** button when one is ready. Finish editing before refreshing; updates never force a reload mid-note. If an older installed version does not show the prompt, open `/share-target` in the browser (GET is a read-only page load). This URL bypasses the old worker's cached navigation and loads the latest page; you can then use **Refresh app** if offered. Close and reopen the installed app afterwards. Do not clear browser site data to update the app: that data may include unsynced notes.

## Share screenshots from Android

On an Android phone or tablet, install Shelf from Chrome while connected to its HTTPS URL. In your screenshots or photos app, tap **Share → Shelf.** The image opens in a new note: add text or more images, then close the note to save it. Closing an empty draft without images does not create a note. Shares received offline can be saved on the device and will sync when Shelf is open and connected again. If the app was installed before this feature was deployed, you may need to reinstall it for Android to register the new share target.

This requires a browser that supports Web Share Target (such as Chrome on Android). iOS/iPadOS PWAs cannot currently appear in the system share sheet; use **Add an image** in Shelf instead.

## Sync behavior

Drag a note by its top-left handle to reorder it within Pinned or Other notes. The handle also supports arrow keys. Order is saved locally first and synced across devices; moving a note does not change its edit date. Newly created notes appear first. When searching, only visible notes can be used as drop targets.

Edits are committed to IndexedDB first and sent to the server immediately when possible. The header distinguishes **Saved on device**, **Syncing…**, **Synced**, and failure/offline states.

Mobile operating systems can suspend web apps after they are backgrounded. An edit made offline may therefore remain only on its original device until Shelf is opened again with connectivity. Incoming shares are temporary on-device drafts (not notes) until saved, and expire after 24 hours.

## Security notes

- Keep the app restricted to the Tailnet.
- Authentication remains enabled as defense in depth.
- Passwords use Argon2id; raw session tokens are never stored in SQLite.
- Cookies are HTTP-only and SameSite Strict; production cookies are Secure behind HTTPS.
- Uploads are limited by count, bytes, decoded dimensions, and detected file contents.
- API mutations reject cross-site browser requests.
- SQLite queries are parameterized and API inputs are parsed with Zod.
